    <h1>Welcome to MJ's Website!</h1>
    <h2>All About Me:</h2>
        <p>Greetings! My name is Mike Javee Galam, preferrably <strong>MJ</strong>.</p>
        <p>I am 20 years old, and currently, I am a student in BCIT.</p>
        <p>When I was little, the doctor diagnosed me with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_palsy">CP</a>.</p>
        <p>When I am not too busy with school, I try to read articles about ancient history and mathematics.</p>
        <p>As much as I love to learn how the world works, I am also an <em>avid</em> fan of the culinary arts!</p>
